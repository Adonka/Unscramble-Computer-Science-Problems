The size of each record can be presented as n and m.
For loop will iterate the number of the size n and m.
One for loop has while loop that loops twice. Therefore,
 2n and m. 
 Finally, it iterate each key of x size of a dictionary 
 to make x size of set which include the output of the for loop.

 Therefore, the time complexity is O(2m + n + n ) = O(2m + 2n)
