The size of the call record can be presented as n.
For loop iterates the call records and store the Bangalore number.
The equation is O(n+n) = O(2n) so far. Searching in dictionary is constant, so O(1).
Then it calculate the sum of num_dic and Bangalore_dic to give the percentage of Bangalore numbers.
The size of each dictionary can be represented as x and y. 

Therefore time complexiy is O(n + 2n + x + y) = O(3n + x + y)
