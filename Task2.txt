The size of the call record can be presented as n.
For loop iterates the call records and store the Bangalore number.
The equation is O(n+n) = O(2n) so far. 
Then it calculate the sum of num_dic to give the max value and max index.
Time complexiy is O(n + 2n) = O(3n)

Therefore the optimized time complexiy is O(n)
