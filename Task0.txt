The size of each record can be presented as n and m.
Then we print the first of text records and the last of call records with the size of n and m.
Since, the constant time is 1 and we have two of printing, the time complexity can be presented as 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the worst case of time complexity is O(1) because it only prints the first and last records.
