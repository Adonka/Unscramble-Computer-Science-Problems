The size of the call record can be presented as n.
For loop iterates the call records and store the Bangalore number.
The equation in the worst case senario is O(n) = O(n) so far. Searching in sets is constant, so O(1).
Then it calculate the length of Bangalore_set with counts to give the percentage of outgoing Bangalore numbers to the other Bangalore numbers.
When set is converted into list, the list is sorted so the time complexity is O(nlogn). 


Therefore the optimized time complexiy is O(nlogn + n) = O(nlogn).
